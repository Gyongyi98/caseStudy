Screenshot project

For creating this tool I have used:
  - Screenshot Master API (https://www.screenshotmachine.com/website-screenshot-api.php)
  - Google Drive API (https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/php)

The files:
- quickstart.php: authentication and other settings in order to connect with Google Drive
- ScreenshotMachine.php: Screenshot machine - website screenshot generator
- upload.php: includes the other two .php file in order to make a screenshots and to transfer them to a specific Google Drive folder
